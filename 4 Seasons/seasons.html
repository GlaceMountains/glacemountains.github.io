		<h1>"Winter, spring, summer or fall. All you've got to do is call, and I'll be there, ye, ye, ye. You've got a friend."</h1>

		<p><img src="weather.jpg" class="bgpic">Seasons come and seasons go. There will always be four, even if some seem shorter or longer than others.Living in Montana, it definitely feels like some seasons are skipped every once in a while.
		One interesting way to look at or appreciate the seasons is through beautiful photographs, funny memes, or quotable quotes. Here is a small compilation of such material for your enjoyment.</p>

<h2>"Each moment of the year has its own beauty."</h2>
<p>  - Ralph Waldo Emerson</p>

<h2>"Like the seasons of the year, life changes frequently and drastically. You enjoy it or endure it as it comes and goes, as it ebbs and flows."</h2>
<p>	 - Burgess Meredith (Quotefancy)</p>
