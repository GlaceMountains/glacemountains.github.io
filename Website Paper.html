<h1>Sweet Peaks Ice Cream</h1><link href="https://www.sweetpeaksicecream.com/">
<P>Sweet Peaks Ice Cream is a local business that got its start in Whitefish, MT. For a smaller business, it has a well designed and fun looking website. The colors are nice, the header has a small scroll effect, and the photos of the different ice cream flavors look delicious.</p>
<p>The coding looks like it is the more recent version of html. I’m not exactly sure if the coding is clean or not, but the end product looks really nice. The layout makes sense and the ability to horizontally scroll through some of the pictures is fun. It’s navigation is also well done, and easy to understand. There is only the navigation bar though, clicking on the map displayed on the homepage doesn’t link to the location’s page like it does through the nav bar.</p>
<p>The website leans toward more neutral colors overall, but is currently displaying some fun fall colors in it’s header and photographs. I think part of its current scheme/design has to do with Sweet Peeks association with some of the national parks. It’s nice that the website lists information about each individual ice cream flavor. I think it’s also one of the first websites where the scroll effect caught my attention. I can’t exactly tell what sets it apart from other websites, maybe I just like it because it is well made and supports a local business.</p>

<h2>Thesaurus.com</h2><link href="https://www.thesaurus.com/">
<P>I’ve always found this website fun to use when I feel like I need to word something differently. It’s nice how when searching for synonyms, it tries to help by sorting the results by relevance. The site also has links to fun writing related articles, as well as its sister site dictionary.com.</p> 
<p>The coding is html and looks like the newest version available. It’s coding also seems pretty crowded, compared to some of the other websites we’ve looked at, but I guess that just means the website has more to it. It’s navigation is pretty easy, though the home button is labeled thesaurus.com, which could confuse someone.</p>
<p>Thesaurus.com’s color scheme is pretty simple with mostly shades of white and a specific orange accent color. Keeping it simple like this is probably good for the usual audience of  people trying to focus on writing a paper. It’s not overly distracting unless an interesting ad pops up. The site is nice because the search bar is easy to access, though if one is curious enough there are alphabetical links to all the words that can be found on the website. Overall, the site is pretty easy to use when looking for the right word.</p>

<h3>The Week: Political Cartoons</h3><link href="https://theweek.com/cartoons">
<P>This website, I usually only use the mobile version of. It’s pretty nice, but there is one thing that I don’t like. If I click on the individual links to a cartoon, then try going back to the main page, it kind of resets. On mobile, backing out of the individual cartoon reloads the page back to the top, and the reload usually changes the cartoons you were looking at so that you could lose whatever one had caught your interest. Maybe it’s a pet peeve that is too small to really be significant, but I also think it is something that could be fixed.</p>
<p>The overall layout is a bit jumbled when looking at the non mobile site. Why can’t the cartoons all be of equal size? The ad placement on the non mobile website is also a bit random, even if it does have a bit of a pattern to it. The navigation bar is a nice drop down menu and makes the rest of the website pretty accessible.</p> 
<p>Other than whatever cartoons are featured, the website has a very neutral balck and white color scheme. The main noticeable color is the red The Week logo at the top of the page. This simple kind of color scheme seems to be common for news websites, therefore fitting it’s usual audience. One thing of note about this website, is it does do a good job of stacking it’s content when viewed on a mobile device.</p>
